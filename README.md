Should-You-Would-You-Could-You-Save-Me
======================================

The game "Should You/Would You/Could You Save Me"


Story:

Rachel's boyfriend, Joseph, was taken by a pack of zombies into the factory where they live. She goes through
level after level to find and save her boyfriend before he dies and the zombies eat him or infect him or whatever
the zombies plan to do... The story starts with her and Joseph (or "Joey" as she calls him) talking asking each other
if they should save the other when something happens. Soon they begin to ask if the other would honestly save them if they
were in a certain situation. This is when Joseph is taken and Rachel has to prove that she was speaking the truth and
that she could save Joseph from anything because of their love for each other.



Gameplay:

Rachel starts with a baseball bat she finds outside the factory and it is used a lot like the sword in The Legend
of Zelda Link to the Past. As she progresses she gets more weapons. The game has a lot of tight corridors and open rooms
too. this allows for the different types of zombies to be used in multiple ways.



Different Enemies:

Waiters: Stand still until they see Rachel and then walk in her direction.

Walkers: walkers... well they walk around in circles until they see Rachel. at which point they will begin to walk
in her direction

Sprinters: Stand still until they see Rachel at which point they will run very fast at her, but they are unable to stop
so they run into walls and die.

Pacers: walk back and forth in a straight line

Perimeter Checkers: Walk the perimeter of the room they are inside of.

Stationary Spitters: Zombies with no legs who have developed the ability to spit acid. Dont Move.

Moving Spitters: same as stationaries but these ones can move.

Saw-Blades: Kill everything that touches them. Meatboy style.

All-Seeing Eye: If a zombie who has seen the player walks over the eye, the zombies knowledge is given to the eye
who tells all other zombies where the player is. Makes every zombie see and chase the player
